# App-Development-With-Swift
Working through the projects in Apple's new Swift book (https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/app-development-with-swift/id1219117996?mt=11).

Each unit contains an app project at the end, which I will upload with my own modifications as I progress.

## Unit 1:
**Light:** 

Description: An app that lets the user flip the screen background from white to black with a single tap.

Modifications:
* Added control over the device's flashlight (torch)
* Added slider for abilitiy to adjust flashlight level
* Added support for display brightness with the slider
